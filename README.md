# bmake
easier cmake alternative 

# install 
just copy the build.sh in your project folder 

# configuration
You only need to setup the variables in the top part of the script

# launch

./build.sh         : build a debug build
./build.sh debug   : build a debug build
./build.sh release : build a release build

# compiler support
only g++ was tested but should work with gcc. Clang will be implemented later
